My personal collection of helpers has grown quite a bit since first releasing this library, and honestly I've been lacking in keeping it up-to-date. This new version will bring in helpers I've found useful whilst [InventoryBase](http://inventorybase.com) and [InventoryBase Mobile](http://inventorybase.com/mobile).

## Important Changes
* Smaller syntax, eg. `eq` instead of `if_eq` (possibly, may roll this back as I'm not sure I like how it reads)
* Simpler syntax, eg. `{{#eq something 2}}` instead of `{{#if_eq something compare=2}}`

## New Helpers
* Strict Comparisons
* Logging
* Inflections

## Improvements
* CoffeeScript (why not?)
* AMD/CommonJS support
* Tests
